# Chatwoot

When a user demands talking to a human agent, we can forward the conversation to the support system. Currently the open source system Chatwoot is the only support system.

## How It Works
1. When an end-user demands talking to a human agent.

2. An agent will get notified when the conversation is assigned to him.

3. The agent can view the history of the conversation and communicate with the end-user in conversation window.

4. The agent can resolve the conversation when he is done with service.

5. After the agent resolves the conversation, next time end-user will start with interacting bot again.

## Configuration
Now you can follow these steps to configure your account in Chatwoot.

### Add Agents 

When you [enable Chatwoot](/reference/support/overview.html#enable-support), we create a Chatwoot organization and add all the owners in your organization to it. The owners added to Chatwoot organization are called agents which are set as administrators by default.

### Set Up Inbox 

When you enable Chatwoot in a chatbot, we will create an inbox named after the chatbot and connect the inbox to the chatbot. When you deploy the chatbot to a channel and end-users send messages to the chatbot through that channel, you can get the conversation in the corresponding inbox. 


Follow these steps to add an agent to the inbox so when it's needed agents can carry on the conversation.

1. Click **Inboxes** > **Settings**
