features:
  - title: CUI for your service
    details: Building valuable services is hard. While we can not help with that, we can make building conversational user interface a lot easier.
  - title: Separation of Concerns
    details: Separate chatbot building into service, interaction and language perception, so different aspects can be handled by different people.
  - title: Declarative
    details: Focus on how you want your chatbot to behave instead of how such behavior should be implemented imperatively, you got Framely for that. 
  - title: Component-First
    details: Never build from scratch, build complex behavior using imported components so your chatbot can automatically improve with each update.
  - title: Hot Fix NLU, You Can 
    details: We don't need computer graphics expert to build great GUI application, regular engineering team should be able to build effective CUI and fix it.
  - title: Open Source Runtime
    details: Reactjs enable teams to focus on their application logic, instead of reinventing GUI wheels. Framely is doing the same for chatbot. 
  - title: Universal Messages
    details: Omnichannel made easy, the universal messages you defined once will get automatically translated into native message for each channel.  
  - title: Support 
    details: Ran into conversations that bot can't handle, hand over to live agent with easy. We support integration with any contact center software.
  - title: Multi-language Ready
    details: The same interaction logic should be shared between all the different languages, so that you can use people with entirely different skillsets for this. 
  - title: Still Not Convinced?
    details: The chatbot generated is in pure kotlin source code, so you can integrate just about any functionality java/kotlin ecosystem has to offer.
