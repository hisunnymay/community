  - title: Hot Fixable NLU 
    details: Accuracy is not the most important metric when it comes to dialog understanding. To deploy a chatbot into production, every thing need to be hot fixable by the operation team.

  - title: Start with API Schema
    details: The services that you want to expose is uniquely defined by API schema, which on one hand, capture the data type of the input and output parameter, and signature of the function, and on the other hand, represent the meaning user expression in the utterances.

  - title: Declare Interaction Logic
    details: Schema defines what information we need to collect from a user in order to deliver the desired user experience. The interaction logic is driven by business logic and goals. Framely provides a set of interaction annotation which a builder can use declaratively to describe what conversational experience they want to provide, and Framely runtime will take care of the rest.

  - title: Link Utterances to Semantics 
    details: Natural language utterances in the different languages is translated to and from schema event by Framely dialog understanding and module. To control the language perception related behavior, the builder only needs to touch the language part of the relevant interaction annotation, by provider exemplars for user utterance and template for bot messaging. No machine learning (ML) and natural language understanding (NLU) training is needed, certainly no need for a Ph.D hire.
